# Lecture 3 Convolutional Neural Networks

## Feature extraction

- Convolution operation:
  - slides filter over input image
  - is to extract local features
- Activation: often ReLU
- Pooling: downsampling image

## Application

- classification
- object detection - draw bounding box
- segmantation
